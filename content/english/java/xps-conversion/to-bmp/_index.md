## Introduction
Welcome to this step-by-step guide on converting XPS (XML Paper Specification) files to BMP (Bitmap) format in Java using Aspose.Page. Aspose.Page for Java is a powerful library that provides comprehensive features for working with XPS documents. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of converting XPS files to BMP images effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.Page for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.Page for Java library in your project. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- Sample XPS File: Prepare a sample XPS document that you want to convert to BMP.
## Import Packages
Include the necessary Aspose.Page packages in your Java code:
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```
Let's break down the conversion process into easy-to-follow steps:
## Step 1: Load XPS Document
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load XPS document
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input.xps");
```
## Step 2: Initialize Options
```java
// Initialize options object with necessary parameters.
BmpSaveOptions options = new BmpSaveOptions();
options.setSmoothingMode(SmoothingMode.HighQuality);
options.setResolution(300);
options.setPageNumbers(new int[]{1, 2, 6});
```
## Step 3: Create Rendering Device
```java
// Create rendering device for BMP format
ImageDevice device = new ImageDevice();
```
## Step 4: Save Document
```java
// Save XPS document to BMP using options and device
document.save(device, options);
```
## Step 5: Iterate and Save Images
```java
// Iterate through document partitions
for (int i = 0; i < device.getResult().length; i++) {
    // Iterate through partition pages
    for (int j = 0; j < device.getResult()[i].length; j++) {
        // Initialize image output stream
        FileOutputStream imageStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "XPStoBMP" + "_" + (i + 1) + "_" + (j + 1) + ".bmp");
        // Write image
        imageStream.write(device.getResult()[i][j], 0, device.getResult()[i][j].length);
        imageStream.close();
    }
}
```
Repeat these steps for any additional customization or modification you may need in the conversion process.
