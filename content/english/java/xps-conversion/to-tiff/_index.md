In today's digital era, document conversion plays a crucial role in various applications. If you're a Java developer seeking a robust solution to convert XPS (XML Paper Specification) documents to TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), Aspose.Page for Java is your go-to library. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process, ensuring you have a smooth experience with detailed explanations and code snippets.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Page for Java library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- A valid license for Aspose.Page for Java. You can obtain a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/), or purchase a full license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages in your Java project. Ensure you have the Aspose.Page for Java library added to your project.
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory
Define the path to your document directory where the input XPS file is located.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load XPS Document
Load the XPS document using the Aspose.Page library.
```java
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input.xps");
```
## Step 3: Initialize TiffSaveOptions
Initialize the TiffSaveOptions object with the necessary parameters, such as smoothing mode, resolution, and specific page numbers.
```java
TiffSaveOptions options = new TiffSaveOptions();
options.setSmoothingMode(SmoothingMode.HighQuality);
options.setResolution(300);
options.setPageNumbers(new int[] { 1, 2, 6 });
```
## Step 4: Create Rendering Device
Create a rendering device for the TIFF format using the ImageDevice class.
```java
ImageDevice device = new ImageDevice();
```
## Step 5: Save Document to TIFF
Save the XPS document to TIFF format using the specified options and rendering device.
```java
document.save(device, options);
```
## Step 6: Iterate and Save TIFF Images
Iterate through the document partitions and pages, initializing image output streams and saving the TIFF images.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < device.getResult().length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < device.getResult()[i].length; j++) {
        FileOutputStream imageStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "XPStoTIFF" + "_" + (i + 1) + "_" + (j + 1) + ".tif");
        imageStream.write(device.getResult()[i][j], 0, device.getResult()[i][j].length);
        imageStream.close();
    }
}
```
