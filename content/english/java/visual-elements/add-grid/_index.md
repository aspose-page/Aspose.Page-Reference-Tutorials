## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance your Java applications with visually appealing grids using Aspose.Page? In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding a grid using Visual Brush in Java with Aspose.Page. Visual Brush allows you to paint an area with a visual content, creating stunning grid effects in your documents.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.Page library installed. You can download it from the [official Aspose.Page for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/java/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
## Import Packages
Ensure you have the necessary packages imported in your Java project:
```java
import java.awt.geom.Point2D;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsCanvas;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsPath;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsPathGeometry;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsTileMode;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsVisualBrush;
```
Let's break down the process into multiple steps to make it easier for you to follow.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 2: Create Magenta Grid Visual Brush
```java
XpsCanvas visualCanvas = doc.createCanvas();
XpsPath visualPath = visualCanvas.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 0,4 L 4,4 4,0 6,0 6,4 10,4 10,6 6,6 6,10 4,10 4,6 0,6 Z"));
visualPath.setFill(doc.createSolidColorBrush(doc.createColor(1f, .61f, 0.1f, 0.61f)));
```
## Step 3: Define Geometry for Magenta Grid Visual Brush
```java
XpsPathGeometry pathGeometry = doc.createPathGeometry();
pathGeometry.addSegment(doc.createPolyLineSegment(new Point2D.Float[] {
    new Point2D.Float(240f, 5f),
    new Point2D.Float(240f, 310f),
    new Point2D.Float(0f, 310f)
}));
pathGeometry.get(0).setStartPoint(new Point2D.Float(0f, 5f));
```
## Step 4: Create New Canvas
```java
XpsCanvas canvas = doc.addCanvas();
canvas.setRenderTransform(doc.createMatrix(1f, 0f, 0f, 1f, 268f, 70f));
```
## Step 5: Add Grid to Canvas
```java
XpsPath gridPath = canvas.addPath(pathGeometry);
gridPath.setFill(doc.createVisualBrush(visualCanvas,
    new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 10f, 10f), new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 10f, 10f)));
((XpsVisualBrush)gridPath.getFill()).setTileMode(XpsTileMode.Tile);
```
## Step 6: Add Red Transparent Rectangle
```java
XpsPath path = canvas.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 10,10 L 228,10 228,100 10,100"));
path.setFill(doc.createSolidColorBrush(doc.createColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
path.setOpacity(0.7f);
```
## Step 7: Save Resultant XPS Document
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "AddGrid_out.xps");
```
Follow these steps, and you'll successfully add a visually appealing grid using Visual Brush in your Java application with Aspose.Page.
