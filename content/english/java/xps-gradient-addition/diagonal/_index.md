## Introduction
In the ever-evolving world of Java development, enhancing the visual appeal of your XPS documents is crucial. One effective way to achieve this is by incorporating diagonal gradients. This tutorial will guide you through the process using Aspose.Page for Java, providing step-by-step instructions and code snippets.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Installed Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
- Aspose.Page for Java library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- A code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages for your Java project. In your code, you can add the following imports:
```java
import java.awt.geom.Point2D;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsGradientBrush;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsGradientStop;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsPath;
```
## Step 1: Set up Your Project
Create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and include the Aspose.Page library in your project dependencies.
## Step 2: Define Document Directory
Set the path to your document directory where the XPS file will be saved:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 3: Create XPS Document
Initialize a new XpsDocument object:
```java
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 4: Add Diagonal Gradient Path
Add a path to the XPS document with a diagonal gradient:
```java
XpsPath path = doc.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 30,20 l 258.24,0 0,56.64 -258.24,0 Z"));
```
## Step 5: Define Linear Gradient Stops
Set up linear gradient stops with specific colors and positions:
```java
List<XpsGradientStop> stops = new LinkedList<>();
stops.add(doc.createGradientStop(doc.createColor(0, 142, 4), 0f));
// ... repeat for other colors and positions
stops.add(doc.createGradientStop(doc.createColor(0, 199, 80), 1f));
```
## Step 6: Apply Linear Gradient to Path
Apply the linear gradient to the previously defined path:
```java
path.setFill(doc.createLinearGradientBrush(new Point2D.Float(10f, 10f), new Point2D.Float(228f, 100f)));
((XpsGradientBrush)path.getFill()).getGradientStops().addAll(stops);
```
## Step 7: Save the Document
Save the XPS document with the added diagonal gradient:
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "LinearGradient.xps");
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully added a diagonal gradient to your XPS document using Aspose.Page for Java. This visually appealing feature can enhance the overall presentation of your documents.
