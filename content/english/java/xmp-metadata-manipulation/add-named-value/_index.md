## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of Java development, handling metadata in EPS files is crucial for maintaining document integrity. Aspose.Page for Java is a powerful library that simplifies this process. In this tutorial, we will delve into the steps to add a named value in XMP metadata using Java, ensuring you have a robust foundation for manipulating EPS files.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.Page for Java requires a functioning JDK. Ensure you have the latest version installed.
- Aspose.Page for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.Page for Java library in your project. You can obtain it from the [official download link](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages are vital for utilizing Aspose.Page for Java functionalities. Include the following in your code:
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.xmp.XmpMetadata;
import com.aspose.eps.xmp.XmpValue;
import com.aspose.page.BaseExamplesTest;
```
Now, let's break down the process into detailed steps to add a named value in XMP metadata using Aspose.Page for Java.
## Step 1: Initialize Input EPS File Stream
Begin by initializing the input EPS file stream. This step sets the stage for loading the EPS document into your Java project.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Initialize input EPS file stream
FileInputStream psStream = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "xmp4.eps");
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(psStream);
FileInputStream psStream = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "xmp4.eps");
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(psStream);
```
## Step 2: Obtain XMP Metadata
Retrieve the existing XMP metadata from the EPS file. If the EPS file lacks XMP metadata, a new one will be generated with values from PS metadata comments.
```java
XmpMetadata xmp = document.getXmpMetadata();
```
## Step 3: Add Named Value
Add a new named value to the XMP metadata structure. In this example, we're adding a value to the "xmpTPg:MaxPageSize" structure.
```java
xmp.addNamedValue("xmpTPg:MaxPageSize", "stDim:newKey", new XmpValue("NewValue"));
```
## Step 4: Initialize Output EPS File Stream
Prepare the output EPS file stream to save the document with the modified XMP metadata.
```java
FileOutputStream outPsStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "xmp4_changed.eps");
```
## Step 5: Save Document
Save the document with the updated XMP metadata.
```java
try {
    document.save(outPsStream);
} finally {
    outPsStream.close();
}
```
## Step 6: Close Input EPS Stream
Finally, ensure to close the input EPS stream to free up resources.
```java
psStream.close();
```
By following these steps, you successfully add a named value in XMP metadata using Aspose.Page for Java, enhancing your EPS file manipulation capabilities.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored the essential steps to seamlessly integrate Aspose.Page for Java into your project for adding named values in XMP metadata. This powerful library empowers Java developers to handle EPS files efficiently, ensuring a smooth workflow.
