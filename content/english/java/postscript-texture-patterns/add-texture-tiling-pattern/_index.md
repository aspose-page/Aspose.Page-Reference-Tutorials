## Introduction
In the realm of Java development, creating intricate patterns and textures in PostScript documents is a common requirement. Aspose.Page for Java proves to be a valuable tool in achieving this task effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of adding a texture tiling pattern in a Java PostScript document using Aspose.Page.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic understanding of Java programming language.
- Familiarity with PostScript document structure.
- Aspose.Page for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages for your Java project:
```java
import java.awt.BasicStroke;
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Font;
import java.awt.TexturePaint;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.device.PsSaveOptions;
```
## Step 1: Create a PostScript Document
Begin by creating a new PostScript document, specifying the output stream and save options. Ensure you have the necessary paths configured.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create output stream for PostScript document
FileOutputStream outPsStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "AddTextureTilingPattern_outPS.ps");
// Create save options with A4 size
PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
// Create new PS Document with the page opened
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, false);
// Create new PS Document with the page opened
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, false);
```
## Step 2: Set Up Graphics Environment
Set up the graphics environment by translating the origin and creating a BufferedImage from the texture image file.
```java
document.writeGraphicsSave();
document.translate(200, 100);
// Create a BufferedImage object from image file
BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(dataDir + "TestTexture.bmp"));
```
## Step 3: Create Texture Brush
Define a texture brush from the image, specifying the area to be covered by the texture.
```java
// Create image area doubled in width
Rectangle2D.Float imageArea = new Rectangle2D.Float(0, 0, image.getWidth() * 2, image.getHeight());
// Create texture brush from the image
TexturePaint paint = new TexturePaint(image, imageArea);
```
## Step 4: Draw and Fill Shapes
Create a rectangle and fill it with the defined texture brush. Additionally, draw and outline the shape for visual appeal.
```java
// Create rectangle
Rectangle2D.Float shape = new Rectangle2D.Float(0, 0, 200, 100);
// Set this texture brush as current paint
document.setPaint(paint);
// Fill rectangle
document.fill(shape);
document.setPaint(Color.RED);
document.setStroke(new BasicStroke(2));
document.draw(shape);
```
## Step 5: Add Text with Texture Pattern
Add text to the document and fill/stroke it with the texture pattern. Customize font, position, and other parameters as needed.
```java
// Fill the text with the texture pattern
Font font = new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 96);
document.fillAndStrokeText("ABC", font, 200, 300, paint, Color.BLACK, new BasicStroke(2));
// Outline the text with the texture pattern
document.outlineText("ABC", font, 200, 400, paint, new BasicStroke(5));
```
## Step 6: Save and Close
Conclude the process by closing the current page, saving the document, and ensuring a seamless execution.
```java
// Close current page
document.closePage();
// Save the document
document.save();
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully added a texture tiling pattern to a Java PostScript document using Aspose.Page for Java. Feel free to explore further customization options and unleash the full potential of this powerful library.
