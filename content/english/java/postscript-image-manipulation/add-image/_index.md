## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to add images to a Java PostScript document using the Aspose.Page for Java library. Aspose.Page is a powerful library that provides various features for working with PostScript files, allowing developers to manipulate and enhance their documents seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Page for Java library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages in your Java project. Use the following code snippet as a reference:
```java
import java.awt.geom.AffineTransform;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.device.PsSaveOptions;
```
## Step 1: Write Graphics Save
The first step involves writing the graphics save to the document. This ensures that any transformations or modifications made afterward can be rolled back if needed.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create output stream for PostScript document
FileOutputStream outPsStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "AddImage_outPS.ps");
// Create save options with A4 size
PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
// Create new PS Document with the page opened
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, false);
document.writeGraphicsSave();
```
## Step 2: Translate and Transform
Next, translate the document and create a BufferedImage object from the image file. Apply a series of transformations like scaling and rotation using AffineTransform.
```java
document.translate(100, 100);
// Create a BufferedImage object from the image file
BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(dataDir + "TestImage Format24bppRgb.jpg"));
// Create image transform
AffineTransform transform = new AffineTransform();
transform.translate(35, 300);
transform.scale(3, 3);
transform.rotate(-45);
```
## Step 3: Add Image to Document
Now, add the transformed image to the document.
```java
document.drawImage(image, transform, null);
```
## Step 4: Write Graphics Restore
After adding the image, write the graphics restore to finalize the changes made.
```java
document.writeGraphicsRestore();
```
## Step 5: Close Current Page and Save
Close the current page and save the document.
```java
document.closePage();
document.save();
```
Repeat these steps for adding multiple images or customize the transformations based on your requirements.
