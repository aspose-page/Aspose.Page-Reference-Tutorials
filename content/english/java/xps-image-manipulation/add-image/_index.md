In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.Page for Java packages to access the required classes and methods.
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsPath;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory
Define the path to your document directory where the XPS document and image files will be stored.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create a New XPS Document
Initialize a new XPS document using the following code snippet:
```java
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 3: Add Image to XPS Document
To add an image, create a path in the XPS document, and set the image brush using the provided image file and coordinates.
```java
XpsPath path = doc.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 30,20 l 258.24,0 0,56.64 -258.24,0 Z"));
path.setRenderTransform(doc.createMatrix(0.7f, 0f, 0f, 0.7f, 0f, 20f));
path.setFill(doc.createImageBrush(dataDir + "QL_logo_color.tif", new Rectangle2D.Double(0f, 0f, 258.24f, 56.64f), new Rectangle2D.Double(50f, 20f, 193.68f, 42.48f)));
```
## Step 4: Save Resultant XPS Document
Save the modified XPS document to your specified directory.
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "AddImage_out.xps");
```
Repeat these steps to add more images or customize the existing ones according to your project requirements.
