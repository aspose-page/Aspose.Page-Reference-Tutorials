## Introduction

Aspose.Page for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to work with various document formats seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting a license using an embedded resource with Aspose.Page for .NET. Licensing is a crucial step in utilizing Aspose.Page functionalities to their full extent, ensuring compliance and unlocking the library's potential.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Page for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Page for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

2. License File: Obtain the license file, commonly named "MergedAPI.Aspose.Total.NET.lic," which is essential for authenticating your use of Aspose.Page. If you don't have a license, you can get a temporary one from [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide on how to set the license using an embedded resource.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your .NET project. This ensures that your application recognizes and can use the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Page library.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Document Directory

Set the path to your document directory, where your project files are located. This directory will be used to locate the license file and other resources.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 2: Initialize License Object

Create an instance of the Aspose.Page.License class to manage the licensing operations.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
Aspose.Page.License license = new Aspose.Page.License();
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 3: Set License

Set the license using the SetLicense method and provide the path to your license file.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
license.SetLicense("MergedAPI.Aspose.Total.NET.lic");
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 4: Enable Embedded License

Indicate that the license will be embedded in the application by setting the Embedded property to true.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
license.Embedded = true;
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 5: Confirm Successful License Set

Finally, display a message confirming that the license has been set successfully.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
// ExEnd:1
```

Repeat these steps in your application to ensure that Aspose.Page is properly licensed and ready to be used in your document processing tasks.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set a license using an embedded resource with Aspose.Page for .NET. This crucial step ensures that your application can take full advantage of Aspose.Page's capabilities while maintaining compliance.
