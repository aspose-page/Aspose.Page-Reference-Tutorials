## Introduction

In the realm of document processing, Aspose.Page for .NET stands out as a powerful toolkit that empowers developers to manipulate XPS documents with ease. One exciting feature it offers is the ability to add diagonal gradients, allowing you to enhance the visual appeal of your documents. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, demonstrating how to incorporate diagonal gradients into XPS files using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Page for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Page for .NET library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment for working with .NET.

Now, let's get started with adding diagonal gradients to XPS using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces from the Aspose.Page library to access the required classes and methods. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Set the Document Directory

Begin by specifying the path to your document directory. This is where the resultant XPS document with the diagonal gradient will be saved.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create a New XPS Document

Initialize a new XpsDocument using the Aspose.Page library.

```csharp
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```

## Step 3: Define Gradient Colors

Create a list of XpsGradientStop objects, each representing a color in the diagonal gradient.

```csharp
List<XpsGradientStop> stops = new List<XpsGradientStop>();
stops.Add(doc.CreateGradientStop(doc.CreateColor(0, 142, 4), 0f));
// ... Repeat for other colors
stops.Add(doc.CreateGradientStop(doc.CreateColor(0, 199, 80), 1f));
```

## Step 4: Add a Diagonal Gradient to a Path

Create a new path with a defined geometry, and apply the diagonal gradient to it. Adjust the rendering transform and fill properties as needed.

```csharp
XpsPath path = doc.AddPath(doc.CreatePathGeometry("M 10,10 L 228,10 228,100 10,100"));
path.RenderTransform = doc.CreateMatrix(1f, 0f, 0f, 1f, 20f, 70f);
path.Fill = doc.CreateLinearGradientBrush(new PointF(10f, 10f), new PointF(228f, 100f));
((XpsGradientBrush)path.Fill).GradientStops.AddRange(stops);
```

## Step 5: Save the Resultant XPS Document

Finally, save the modified XPS document to the specified directory.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "AddDiagonalGradient_outXPS.xps");
```

Now you've successfully added a diagonal gradient to an XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET. Experiment with different colors and geometries to create stunning visual effects.

## Conclusion

Aspose.Page for .NET simplifies the process of enhancing XPS documents with diagonal gradients. This tutorial has walked you through the steps, from setting up prerequisites to saving the final document. Explore further possibilities and elevate your document presentation.
