## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on using Aspose.Page for .NET to add glyph clones and change colors in your XPS documents. Aspose.Page for .NET is a powerful library that enables you to work with XPS files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will focus on the process of adding glyph clones and altering their colors, enhancing the visual appeal of your documents.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio or any other preferred C# development environment installed.
- Aspose.Page for .NET library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- Familiarity with the XPS document format.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, include the necessary namespaces in your C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory

Begin by setting up the directory where your documents will be stored:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create the First XPS Document

Now, let's create the first XPS document:

```csharp
XpsDocument doc1 = new XpsDocument();
```

## Step 3: Add Glyphs to the First Document

Add glyphs to the first document using the specified parameters:

```csharp
XpsGlyphs glyphs = doc1.AddGlyphs("Times New Roman", 200, FontStyle.Bold, 50, 250, "Test");
```

## Step 4: Fill Glyphs in the First Document with Color

Fill the glyphs in the first document with a solid color, for example, green:

```csharp
glyphs.Fill = doc1.CreateSolidColorBrush(Color.Green);
```

## Step 5: Create the Second XPS Document

Now, create the second XPS document:

```csharp
XpsDocument doc2 = new XpsDocument();
```

## Step 6: Add Glyphs Cloned from the First Document

Clone glyphs from the first document and add them to the second document:

```csharp
glyphs = doc2.Add(glyphs.Clone());
```

## Step 7: Fill Glyphs in the Second Document with Another Color

Change the color of the cloned glyphs in the second document, for example, to red:

```csharp
((XpsSolidColorBrush)glyphs.Fill).Color = doc2.CreateColor(Color.Red);
```

## Step 8: Save the First XPS Document

Save the first XPS document:

```csharp
doc1.Save(dataDir + "out1.xps");
```

## Step 9: Save the Second XPS Document

Save the second XPS document:

```csharp
doc2.Save(dataDir + "out2.xps");
```

Congratulations! You have successfully added glyph clones and changed colors in your XPS documents using Aspose.Page for .NET.
