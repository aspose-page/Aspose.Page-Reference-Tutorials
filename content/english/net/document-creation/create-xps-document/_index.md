## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on creating XPS documents using Aspose.Page for .NET. In this tutorial, we will explore the process of generating XPS files, a widely used format for electronic documents. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Aspose.Page, this guide is tailored to help you seamlessly create XPS documents with clear examples and detailed explanations.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Page for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Page library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

2. Your Document Directory: Choose or create a directory on your system where you want to save the output XPS files.

Now, let's jump into the tutorial!

## Import Namespaces

In order to use Aspose.Page for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Reference to Aspose.Page

In your project, add a reference to the Aspose.Page for .NET library. You can find the required DLL in the downloaded package.

### Step 2: Import Namespaces

Include the following namespaces in your code file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

Now that we have set up the prerequisites and imported the necessary namespaces, let's break down the process of creating an XPS document into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```csharp
string dir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save the output XPS file.

## Step 2: Create XPS Document

```csharp
XpsDocument xDocs = new XpsDocument();
```

Initialize a new XPS document using the `XpsDocument` class.

## Step 3: Add Glyphs to the Document

```csharp
var glyphs = xDocs.AddGlyphs("Arial", 12, FontStyle.Regular, 300f, 450f, "Hello World!");
```

Use the `AddGlyphs` method to add glyphs (text) to the document. Customize the font, size, style, and position as needed.

## Step 4: Set Glyph Fill Color

```csharp
glyphs.Fill = xDocs.CreateSolidColorBrush(Color.Black);
```

Specify the fill color for the added glyphs. In this example, we use black, but you can choose any color.

## Step 5: Save the Result

```csharp
xDocs.Save(dir + "output.xps");
```

Finally, save the XPS document to the specified directory with the desired filename. The resulting XPS file will contain the "Hello World!" text.

Congratulations! You've successfully created an XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET.
