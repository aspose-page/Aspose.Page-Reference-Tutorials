## Introduction

Opacity masks are essential when you want to create visually appealing documents with varying levels of transparency. Aspose.Page for .NET simplifies this process, offering developers a comprehensive set of tools to enhance XPS documents. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to set an opacity mask in a step-by-step guide.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed. If not, you can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your XPS documents.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.Xps;
using Aspose.Page.Xps.XpsModel;
using Aspose.Page.Xps.XpsModel.Shapes;
using Aspose.Page.Xps.XpsModel.Text;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Create a New XPS Document

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create new XPS Document
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```

Start by creating a new XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Step 2: Add Canvas to XpsDocument Instance

```csharp
// Add Canvas to XpsDocument instance
XpsCanvas canvas = doc.AddCanvas();
```

Now, add a canvas to the XPS document. The canvas will serve as a container for various graphical elements.

## Step 3: Add Rectangle with Opacity Mask

```csharp
// Rectangle with opacity masked by ImageBrush
XpsPath path = canvas.AddPath(doc.CreatePathGeometry("M 10,180 L 228,180 228,285 10,285"));
path.Fill = doc.CreateSolidColorBrush(doc.CreateColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
path.OpacityMask = doc.CreateImageBrush(dataDir + "R08SY_NN.tif", new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 128f, 192f),
    new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 64f, 96f));
((XpsImageBrush)path.OpacityMask).TileMode = XpsTileMode.Tile;
```

Add a rectangle to the canvas and set its opacity using the `OpacityMask` property. In this example, we are using an image as the opacity mask.

## Step 4: Save Resultant XPS Document

```csharp
// Save resultant XPS document
doc.Save(dataDir + "OpacityMask_out.xps");
```

Finally, save the modified XPS document with the opacity mask applied.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to set opacity masks in XPS documents using Aspose.Page for .NET. This feature opens up a realm of creative possibilities for designing sophisticated and visually appealing documents.
