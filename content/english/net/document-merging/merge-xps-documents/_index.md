## Introduction

Are you looking to merge XPS documents seamlessly using Aspose.Page for .NET? This tutorial will walk you through the process, providing step-by-step guidance on merging XPS files effortlessly. Aspose.Page for .NET is a powerful library that simplifies document manipulation tasks, making it an ideal choice for merging XPS documents. Let's dive into the process and explore how you can achieve this with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic understanding of C# and .NET framework.
- Aspose.Page for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- XPS documents that you want to merge.

## Import Namespaces

In your C# code, ensure you import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities of Aspose.Page for .NET:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Start by creating a new C# project in your preferred development environment. Make sure to reference the Aspose.Page for .NET library in your project.

## Step 2: Initialize Streams

In your C# code, initialize the output and input streams for XPS documents. This involves opening the existing XPS document and creating a new one for the merged output.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize XPS output stream
using (System.IO.Stream outStream = System.IO.File.Open(dataDir + "mergedXPSfiles.xps", System.IO.FileMode.OpenOrCreate, System.IO.FileAccess.Write))
// Initialize XPS input stream
using (System.IO.Stream inStream = System.IO.File.Open(dataDir + "input.xps", System.IO.FileMode.Open))
```

## Step 3: Load XPS Document

Load the XPS document from the input stream using Aspose.Page for .NET's `XpsDocument` class.

```csharp
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(inStream, new XpsLoadOptions());
```

## Step 4: Create an Array of XPS Files

To merge multiple XPS files, create an array containing the paths to the files you want to merge.

```csharp
string[] filesToMerge = new string[] { dataDir + "Demo.xps", dataDir + "sample.xps" };
```

## Step 5: Merge XPS Files

Now, merge the XPS files into the output stream using the `Merge` method of the `XpsDocument` class.

```csharp
document.Merge(filesToMerge, outStream);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully merged XPS documents using Aspose.Page for .NET. This simple yet powerful process enables you to combine multiple XPS files effortlessly, streamlining your document management tasks.
