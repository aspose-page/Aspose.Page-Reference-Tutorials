## Introduction

Are you struggling with manipulating EPS images in your .NET applications? Look no further! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of cropping EPS images using the powerful Aspose.Page for .NET library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this step-by-step guide will help you achieve precise image cropping effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of .NET development.
- Aspose.Page for .NET library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- A sample EPS image (replace "input.eps" in the code with your actual file).

## Import Namespaces

Let's kick off by importing the necessary namespaces for our code to run smoothly. 

```csharp
using Aspose.Page;
using Aspose.Page.EPS;
using Aspose.Page.EPS.Device;
using Aspose.Page.EPS.XMP;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now, let's break down the tutorial into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Initialize PsDocument

```csharp
PsDocument doc = new PsDocument(inputEpsStream);
```

Initialize a `PsDocument` object with the input EPS stream.

## Step 2: Extract Bounding Box

```csharp
int[] initialBoundingBox = doc.ExtractEpsBoundingBox();
```

Retrieve the initial bounding box of the EPS image.

## Step 3: Create Output Stream

```csharp
using (Stream outputEpsStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "output_crop.eps", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
```

Create an output stream for the cropped EPS image.

## Step 4: Define New Bounding Box

```csharp
float[] newBoundingBox = new float[] { 260, 300, 480, 432 };
```

Define a new bounding box for cropping. Ensure the new values are within the initial bounding box.

## Step 5: Crop and Save

```csharp
doc.CropEps(outputEpsStream, newBoundingBox);
```

Crop the EPS image using the new bounding box and save it to the output stream.

Repeat these steps for different resizing scenarios.

## Resizing EPS Images

### Resize in Inches

```csharp
doc.ResizeEps(outputEpsStream, new SizeF(5.791f, 3.625f), Units.Inches);
```

Resize the EPS image and save it with the specified dimensions in inches.

### Resize in Millimeters

```csharp
doc.ResizeEps(outputEpsStream, new SizeF(196, 123), Units.Millimeters);
```

Resize the EPS image and save it with the specified dimensions in millimeters.

### Resize in Percents

```csharp
doc.ResizeEps(outputEpsStream, new SizeF(200, 200), Units.Percents);
```

Resize the EPS image and save it with the specified dimensions in percentages.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to crop and resize EPS images using Aspose.Page for .NET. Now, enhance your image manipulation capabilities and bring your .NET applications to the next level.
