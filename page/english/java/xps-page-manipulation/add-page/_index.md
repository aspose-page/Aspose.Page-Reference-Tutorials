# Aspose.Page Java - Add Pages to XPS Tutorial

## Introduction
If you're looking to enhance your Java application's capabilities by adding pages to XPS documents, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process using Aspose.Page for Java. Aspose.Page is a powerful and versatile library that simplifies the manipulation of XPS files, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking efficient solutions.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.Page is designed to work seamlessly with Java, so make sure you have the JDK installed on your system.
- Aspose.Page for Java Library: You'll need to download and install the Aspose.Page for Java library. You can find the library and its documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/page/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use your preferred Java IDE for coding. If you don't have one, consider IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other of your choice.
## Import Packages
Once you have the prerequisites set up, start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This step ensures that your code can access the Aspose.Page functionalities seamlessly.
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
```
Now let's break down the code into multiple steps for a clearer understanding:
## Step 1: Set Document Directory Path
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your XPS document is stored or where you want to save the modified document.
## Step 2: Create XPS Document
```java
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "Aspose.xps");
```
This line creates a new XPS document using Aspose.Page, and it takes the path of the existing XPS document ("Aspose.xps" in this case).
## Step 3: Insert an Empty Page
```java
doc.insertPage(1, true);
```
Here, we insert an empty page at the beginning of the existing pages list. The `1` parameter indicates the position where the new page will be added.
## Step 4: Save Resultant XPS Document
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "AddPages_out.xps");
```
Finally, save the modified XPS document with the added page. The resulting document will be saved with the filename "AddPages_out.xps."
By following these steps, you've successfully added a page to a Java XPS document using Aspose.Page.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, Aspose.Page for Java simplifies the process of manipulating XPS documents. Adding pages to your XPS files is now a straightforward task, thanks to the powerful features offered by Aspose.Page.
