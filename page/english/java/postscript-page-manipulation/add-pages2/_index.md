# Aspose.Page Java Tutorial - Adding Pages in PostScript

## Introduction
In the world of document manipulation and management, Aspose.Page for Java emerges as a powerful tool to handle PostScript documents. Adding pages to a PostScript document is a common requirement in many applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the process of adding pages using Aspose.Page for Java, breaking down each step to make the learning experience seamless.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Installed Aspose.Page for Java library.
- Java development environment set up.
## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. This includes the Aspose.Page library. Make sure you have the correct dependencies in your project configuration.
```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.device.PsSaveOptions;
```
## Step 1: Create a Multipaged PostScript Document
Begin by setting up a new multipaged PostScript document. This involves creating an instance of `PsDocument` and specifying the output stream and save options.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create output stream for PostScript document
FileOutputStream outPsStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "AddPages2_outPS.ps");
// Create save options with A4 size
PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
// Set variable that indicates if resulting PostScript document will be multipaged
boolean multiPaged = true;
// Create new multipaged PS Document with one page opened
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, multiPaged);
```
## Step 2: Add Content to the First Page
Now that you have initialized the document, it's time to add content to the first page. This can include text, images, or any other elements you wish to include.
```java
// Add content to the first page
// Close the first page
document.closePage();
```
## Step 3: Add a Second Page with Different Size
To add a second page with a different size, follow these steps:
```java
// Add the second page with a different size
document.openPage(500, 300);
// Add content to the second page
// Close the second page
document.closePage();
```
## Step 4: Save the Document
Finally, save the modified document after adding the required pages. This ensures that your changes are preserved.
```java
// Save the document
document.save();
```
By following these steps, you can seamlessly add pages to a Java PostScript document using Aspose.Page, enhancing your document manipulation capabilities.
## Conclusion
Aspose.Page for Java provides a robust solution for handling PostScript documents, allowing developers to effortlessly manipulate pages. By following this step-by-step guide, you've learned how to add pages to a document, opening up a world of possibilities for your Java applications.
