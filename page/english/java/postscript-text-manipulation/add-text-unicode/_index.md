# Revitalize Java PostScript - Add Unicode with Aspose.Page

## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance your Java PostScript application by seamlessly adding Unicode text? Look no further! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process step by step using Aspose.Page for Java. Aspose.Page is a powerful library that allows you to manipulate and convert PostScript and XPS files with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Aspose.Page for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Page library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the necessary packages for Aspose.Page. Add the following lines to your code:
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsFontStyle;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsGlyphs;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsSolidColorBrush;
import java.awt.Color;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a new Java project in your IDE and set up the project structure. Make sure to include the Aspose.Page library in your project dependencies.
## Step 2: Initialize XPS Document
Start by initializing a new XPS document within your project:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 3: Add Unicode Text
Now, let's add Unicode text to your XPS document using the Aspose.Page library. Use the following code snippet:
```java
XpsSolidColorBrush textFill = doc.createSolidColorBrush(Color.BLACK);
XpsGlyphs glyphs = doc.addGlyphs("Arial", 20, XpsFontStyle.Regular, 400f, 200f, "AVAJ rof SPX.esopsA");
glyphs.setBidiLevel(1);
glyphs.setFill(textFill);
```
This code segment adds Unicode text "AVAJ rof SPX.esopsA" to the XPS document at coordinates (400, 200) with specified font and style.
## Step 4: Save the Document
Save the resultant XPS document using the following code:
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "AddEncodingText_out.xps");
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully added Unicode text to your Java PostScript application using Aspose.Page. This guide demonstrated a simple yet powerful method to enhance your projects.
