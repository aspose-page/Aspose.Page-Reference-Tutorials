## Common Use Cases for Drawing Rectangles in Java PostScript

- **Report headers:** Use rectangles as colored banners or section dividers.
- **Invoice tables:** Outline cells or highlight totals with styled rectangles.
- **Graphic badges:** Create custom stamps, watermarks, or call‑out boxes.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Incorrect dimensions:** Verify the coordinate system (points) used by PostScript; the origin is at the bottom‑left corner.
- **Missing colors:** Ensure you set both fill and stroke colors; otherwise the rectangle may appear invisible.
- **Performance concerns:** For documents with thousands of shapes, batch the drawing commands to reduce processing overhead.

**Q: Can I draw multiple rectangles in a single document?**  
A: Absolutely. Call the rectangle‑adding method repeatedly with different coordinates and styles.

**Q: Does Aspose.Page support transparency for rectangles?**  
A: Yes, you can set the alpha channel on fill colors to achieve semi‑transparent effects.

**Q: Is it possible to rotate a rectangle?**  
A: You can apply a transformation matrix before drawing the shape to rotate, scale, or skew it.

**Q: What file formats can I export after adding shapes?**  
A: Besides native PostScript (.ps), you can convert to PDF, XPS, or image formats like PNG and JPEG.

**Q: Do I need a license for development use?**  
A: A temporary evaluation license is sufficient for development and testing; a full license is required for production deployments.
