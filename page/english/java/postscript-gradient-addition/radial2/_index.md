# Radial Gradient Example: Java PostScript with Aspose.Page

## Introduction
In this tutorial you’ll build a **radial gradient example** for a PostScript document using Aspose.Page for Java. We’ll walk through every step—from setting up the project to rendering a circle filled with a smooth radial gradient—so you can add eye‑catching graphics to your Java applications instantly.

## Quick Answers
- **What does this tutorial create?** A PostScript file (`.ps`) containing a circle filled with a radial gradient.  
- **Which library is required?** Aspose.Page for Java (latest version).  
- **How long does implementation take?** Approximately 10‑15 minutes for a working example.  
- **Do I need a license?** A temporary or full license is required for production use; a free trial works for development.  
- **Can I reuse the code for PDF or SVG?** Yes—Aspose.Page supports multiple output formats with minimal changes.

## What Is a Radial Gradient?
A radial gradient transitions colors outward from a central point, creating a smooth, circular blend. It’s ideal for highlights, button backgrounds, or any visual that needs a natural “glow” effect.

## Why Use Aspose.Page for Radial Gradients?
- **Device‑independent rendering** – works the same on PostScript, PDF, SVG, and more.  
- **Full Java integration** – no native code, just plain Java APIs.  
- **High‑quality output** – supports anti‑aliasing and color‑space control.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, make sure you have:

- Basic familiarity with Java programming.  
- JDK 8 or newer installed on your machine.  
- Aspose.Page for Java library (download from the [Aspose.Page Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/java/)).  

## Import Packages
First, import the classes we’ll need. These include standard AWT graphics types and the Aspose.Page API.

```java
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.MultipleGradientPaint;
import java.awt.RadialGradientPaint;
import java.awt.geom.AffineTransform;
import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;
import java.awt.geom.Point2D;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.device.PsSaveOptions;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory
Define the folder where the generated PostScript file will be saved. Replace the placeholder with an actual path on your system.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Output Stream
Open a `FileOutputStream` that points to the target `.ps` file. This stream feeds the binary data generated by Aspose.Page.

```java
FileOutputStream outPsStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "RadialGradient2_outPS.ps");
```

## Step 3: Create Save Options
Instantiate `PsSaveOptions`. You can customize page size, compression, etc., but the defaults are fine for this example.

```java
PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
```

## Step 4: Create PS Document
Create the `PsDocument` object, passing the output stream and save options. The `false` flag tells Aspose.Page not to automatically open a page (we’ll do it manually).

```java
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, false);
```

## Step 5: Create a Circle
We’ll draw a circle using `Ellipse2D.Float`. The parameters are `(x, y, width, height)`. Setting width = height creates a perfect circle.

```java
Ellipse2D.Float circle = new Ellipse2D.Float(200, 100, 200, 200);
```

## Step 6: Define Gradient Colors
Prepare two arrays: one for the colors that will appear in the gradient and another for the corresponding fractional positions (0 = center, 1 = edge).

```java
Color[] colors = { Color.WHITE, Color.WHITE, Color.BLUE };
float[] fractions = { 0.0f, 0.2f, 1.0f };
```

## Step 7: Create AffineTransform
The `AffineTransform` scales and translates the gradient to fit our circle. The matrix `(scaleX, 0, 0, scaleY, translateX, translateY)` does the job.

```java
AffineTransform transform = new AffineTransform(200, 0, 0, 200, 200, 100);
```

## Step 8: Create Radial Gradient Paint
Now we build the `RadialGradientPaint` object. It takes the center point, radius, focus point, color fractions, color array, cycle method, color space, and the transform we just defined.

```java
RadialGradientPaint paint = new RadialGradientPaint(
        new Point2D.Float(64, 64),   // gradient center
        68,                          // radius
        new Point2D.Float(24, 24),   // focus point
        fractions,
        colors,
        MultipleGradientPaint.CycleMethod.NO_CYCLE,
        MultipleGradientPaint.ColorSpaceType.SRGB,
        transform);
```

## Step 9: Set Paint and Fill Circle
Apply the gradient paint to the document and fill the previously defined circle. This is the core of our **radial gradient example**.

```java
document.setPaint(paint);
document.fill(circle);
```

## Step 10: Close Page and Save Document
Finalize the page, write the content to disk, and close the stream. Your PostScript file is now ready to view with any PS viewer.

```java
document.closePage();
document.save();
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a radial gradient example in Java PostScript using Aspose.Page.

## Common Issues and Solutions
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **FileNotFoundException** when opening the output stream | Verify that `dataDir` points to an existing folder and you have write permissions. |
| Gradient looks flat or missing | Ensure the `fractions` array matches the `colors` array length and that the `AffineTransform` scales correctly. |
| Colors appear inverted | Swap the order of colors in the `colors` array or adjust the `focus` point coordinates. |
