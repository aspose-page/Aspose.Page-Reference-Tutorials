## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Start by setting up your Java project, ensuring that Aspose.Page for Java is properly integrated.
## Step 2: Create XPS Document
Initialize a new XPS document using the following code:
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create new XPS Document
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 3: Define Tiled Image Path
Specify the path to the tiled image you want to add to the XPS document.
## Step 4: Add Tiled Image
Utilize the code snippet below to add a tiled image to the XPS document:
```java
// Tile image
// ImageBrush filled rectangle in the right top below
XpsPath path = doc.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 10,160 L 228,160 228,305 10,305"));
path.setFill(doc.createImageBrush(dataDir +  "R08LN_NN.jpg",
                                new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 128f, 96f), new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 64f, 48f)));
((XpsImageBrush)path.getFill()).setTileMode(XpsTileMode.Tile);
path.getFill().setOpacity(0.5f);
```
## Step 5: Save the Document
Finally, save the resultant XPS document using the code below:
```java
// Save resultant XPS document
doc.save(dataDir + "AddTiledImage_out.xps"); 
```
