# Convert PostScript to PDF in Java

## Introduction
In the world of Java development, converting PostScript files to PDF is a common requirement. Aspose.Page for Java provides a robust solution for this task, offering developers a seamless experience in handling PostScript documents and transforming them into PDF format.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): As this tutorial involves Java programming, make sure you have the latest JDK installed on your system.
- Aspose.Page for Java Library: You'll need to download and include the Aspose.Page library in your Java project. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages are essential for interacting with PostScript files and handling the conversion process.
```java
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.device.PdfSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.page.License;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Before you start coding, ensure that you have a working Java development environment. Install the latest JDK, and set up your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
## Step 2: Download and Include Aspose.Page Library
Visit the [Aspose.Page for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/) and download the latest version of the library. Once downloaded, include it in your Java project by adding the JAR file to your classpath.
## Step 3: Create a Java Class
Create a new Java class in your project to house the conversion logic. You can name it something like `PostScriptToPdfConverter`.
## Step 4: Import Aspose.Page Packages
In your Java class, import the necessary Aspose.Page packages to use the functionalities required for handling PostScript files.
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import com.aspose.eps.PsDocument;
import com.aspose.eps.saveoptions.PdfSaveOptions;
```
## Step 5: Initialize Input and Output Streams
Set up input and output streams to handle the PostScript input file and PDF output file.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
FileOutputStream pdfStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "PStoPDF.pdf");
FileInputStream psStream = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "input.ps");
```
## Step 6: Load the PostScript Document
Use Aspose.Page to load the PostScript document from the input stream.
```java
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(psStream);
```
## Step 7: Set Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options, such as suppressing minor errors during the conversion process.
```java
boolean suppressErrors = true;
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions(suppressErrors);
// Add additional fonts folders if needed
//options.setAdditionalFontsFolders(new String[] {"FONTS_FOLDER"});
```
## Step 8: Initialize PDF Device
Initialize the PDF device for the conversion process.
```java
com.aspose.eps.device.PdfDevice device = new com.aspose.eps.device.PdfDevice(pdfStream);
// Specify page size and image format if needed
//com.aspose.eps.device.PdfDevice device = new com.aspose.eps.device.PdfDevice(pdfStream, new Dimension(595, 842));
```
## Step 9: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the PDF document.
```java
try {
    document.save(device, options);
} finally {
    psStream.close();
    pdfStream.close();
}
```
## Step 10: Review Errors (Optional)
If you chose to suppress errors during the conversion, you can review any exceptions that occurred.
```java
if (suppressErrors) {
    for (Exception ex : options.getExceptions()) {
        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```
Now you have successfully converted a PostScript file to PDF using Aspose.Page for Java. Experiment with different options and integrate this functionality into your Java applications effortlessly.
