## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to convert XPS (XML Paper Specification) files to JPEG images using Aspose.Page for Java. Aspose.Page is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with XPS and other document formats seamlessly. This step-by-step guide will help you understand the process and implement it in your Java applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.
- Aspose.Page for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Page for Java library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- Sample XPS Document: Have a sample XPS document that you want to convert to JPEG.
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Paths and XPS Document
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Initialize XPS input stream
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input.xps");
```
## Step 2: Set JpegSaveOptions
```java
// Initialize options object with necessary parameters.
JpegSaveOptions options = new JpegSaveOptions();
options.setSmoothingMode(SmoothingMode.HighQuality);
options.setResolution(300);
options.setPageNumbers(new int[] { 1, 2, 6 });
```
## Step 3: Create Rendering Device
```java
// Create rendering device for PDF format
ImageDevice device = new ImageDevice();
```
## Step 4: Save XPS as JPEG
```java
document.save(device, options);
```
## Step 5: Iterate and Save JPEG Pages
```java
// Iterate through document partitions (fixed documents, in XPS terms)
for (int i = 0; i < device.getResult().length; i++) {
    // Iterate through partition pages
    for (int j = 0; j < device.getResult()[i].length; j++) {
        // Initialize image output stream
        FileOutputStream imageStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "XPStoJPEG" + "_" + (i + 1) + "_" + (j + 1) + ".jpeg");
        // Write image
        imageStream.write(device.getResult()[i][j], 0, device.getResult()[i][j].length);
        //close the stream
        imageStream.close();
    }
}
```
This series of steps will effectively convert your XPS document to JPEG images, each saved separately.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to convert XPS to JPEG in Java using Aspose.Page. This process is invaluable for developers working with document conversion in Java applications.
