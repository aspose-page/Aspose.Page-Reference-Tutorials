# Convert XPS to PNG in Java

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of software development, the need to convert XPS (XML Paper Specification) documents to PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images arises frequently. To accomplish this task seamlessly in Java, Aspose.Page provides a powerful solution. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of converting XPS to PNG using Aspose.Page for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Page for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Page library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a Java-compatible IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the necessary packages to utilize Aspose.Page functionalities. Add the following import statements at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
```
## Step 1: Set Document Directory
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load XPS Document
```java
// Load XPS document
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input.xps");
```
## Step 3: Initialize Options
```java
// Initialize options object with necessary parameters.
PngSaveOptions options = new PngSaveOptions();
options.setSmoothingMode(SmoothingMode.HighQuality);
options.setResolution(300);
options.setPageNumbers(new int[] { 1, 2, 6 });
```
## Step 4: Create Rendering Device
```java
// Create rendering device for PDF format
ImageDevice device = new ImageDevice();
```
## Step 5: Save and Iterate
```java
// Save XPS document to PNG using options and device
document.save(device, options);
// Iterate through document partitions (fixed documents, in XPS terms)
for (int i = 0; i < device.getResult().length; i++) {
    // Iterate through partition pages
    for (int j = 0; j < device.getResult()[i].length; j++) {
        // Initialize image output stream
        FileOutputStream imageStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "XPStoPNG" + "_" + (i + 1) + "_" + (j + 1) + ".png");
        // Write image
        imageStream.write(device.getResult()[i][j], 0, device.getResult()[i][j].length);
        // Close the Stream
        imageStream.close();
    }
}
```
By following these steps, you can effortlessly convert XPS documents to PNG images using Aspose.Page for Java.
