## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on setting opacity masks in Java XPS using Aspose.Page. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating an XPS document, adding a canvas, and applying an opacity mask to a rectangle using the powerful features of Aspose.Page for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.Page for Java library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/java/).
- A valid license for Aspose.Page. If you don't have one, you can obtain a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- A development environment set up to run Java applications.
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. Ensure that you have the Aspose.Page library properly integrated. Below is a snippet to guide you:
```java
import com.aspose.xps.XpsCanvas;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsImageBrush;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsPath;
import com.aspose.xps.XpsTileMode;
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
```
Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Create a New XPS Document
```java
// Create a new XPS document
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
```
## Step 2: Add a Canvas
```java
// New canvas
XpsCanvas canvas = doc.addCanvas();
```
## Step 3: Add a Rectangle with Opacity Mask
```java
// Rectangle in the middle left with opacity masked by ImageBrush
XpsPath path = canvas.addPath(doc.createPathGeometry("M 10,180 L 228,180 228,285 10,285"));
path.setFill(doc.createSolidColorBrush(doc.createColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
```
## Step 4: Set Opacity Mask with ImageBrush
```java
path.setOpacityMask(doc.createImageBrush(dataDir +  "R08SY_NN.tif", 
                    new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 128f, 192f), new Rectangle2D.Float(0f, 0f, 64f, 96f)));
((XpsImageBrush)path.getOpacityMask()).setTileMode(XpsTileMode.Tile);
```
## Step 5: Save the Resultant XPS Document
```java
// Save resultant XPS document
doc.save(dataDir + "OpacityMask_out.xps"); 
```
Follow these steps carefully to incorporate opacity masks into your Java XPS document using Aspose.Page.
