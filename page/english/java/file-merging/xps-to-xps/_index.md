# Mastering XPS File Merging in Java with Aspose.Page

## Introduction
In the realm of Java development, managing and manipulating XPS files is a common requirement. Whether you're dealing with reports, presentations, or any other XPS document, the ability to merge multiple files seamlessly is a valuable skill. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of merging XPS files using Aspose.Page for Java, a powerful Java API for working with XPS documents.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Aspose.Page for Java: Download and install Aspose.Page for Java library from the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). 
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE; popular choices include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
Now, let's dive into the core of the tutorial.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, start by importing the necessary packages to make use of Aspose.Page for Java. Add the following lines at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

import com.aspose.xps.XpsDocument;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a new Java project in your chosen IDE. Make sure to include the Aspose.Page library in your project's dependencies.
## Step 2: Initialize XPS Output Stream
Set up the output stream for the merged XPS file. Specify the directory where you want the merged file to be saved.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(dataDir + "mergedXPSfiles.xps");
```
## Step 3: Load the First XPS File
Load the first XPS file that will serve as the base for merging.
```java
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input.xps");
```
## Step 4: Create an Array of XPS Files
Prepare an array of XPS files that you want to merge with the first one.
```java
String[] filesForMerge = new String[] { dataDir + "Demo.xps", dataDir + "sample.xps" };
```
## Step 5: Merge and Save
Execute the merging process and save the result to the specified output stream.
```java
document.merge(filesForMerge, outStream);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully merged XPS files using Aspose.Page for Java.
