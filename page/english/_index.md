## Common Use Cases & Tips
- **Merging multiple PDFs into a single report:** Use the *Document Merging* tutorial for .NET or *File Merging* for Java.  
- **Adding a gradient header before merging:** Apply a gradient using the *Gradient Fills* guide, then merge the pages.  
- **Converting PostScript files before merge:** Convert with the *PostScript Conversion* tutorial, then combine the resulting PDFs.  
- **Managing images across merged documents:** Standardize image resolution with the *Image Management* tutorial to keep file size down.  
- **Editing text after a merge:** Use the *Text Manipulation* guide to replace placeholders or update footers across the merged document.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I merge PDF and PostScript files in a single operation?**  
A: Yes. Convert the PostScript file to PDF first (see the PostScript Conversion tutorial) and then use the Document Merging guide to combine the PDFs.

**Q: Does Aspose.Page support adding gradients to merged pages?**  
A: Absolutely. Apply gradients using the Gradient Fills tutorial before you merge, and the visual effect will be retained in the final document.

**Q: How do I ensure images keep their original quality after merging?**  
A: Use the Image Management tutorial to set appropriate DPI and compression settings before merging. This prevents unwanted down‑sampling.

**Q: Is it possible to edit text in a merged document without re‑creating pages?**  
A: Yes. The Text Manipulation tutorials show how to locate and replace text strings after the merge operation.

**Q: What licensing is required for production use?**  
A: A commercial Aspose.Page license is required for production deployments. A free trial can be used for evaluation and development.
