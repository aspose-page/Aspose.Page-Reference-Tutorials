Include a custom job print ticket, configuring various print settings such as collation, copies, rendering intent, color management, and more.

```csharp
xDocs.JobPrintTicket = new JobPrintTicket(
    new PageDevModeSnaphot("SABlAGwAbABvACEAAAA="),
    new DocumentCollate(Collate.CollateOption.Collated),
    // Add other print settings as needed
);
```

## Step 4: Save the Document
