In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of editing print tickets with practical examples, breaking down each step for a seamless learning experience.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Page for .NET library downloaded and referenced in your project.

If you haven't already installed Aspose.Page for .NET, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To begin with, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project. This ensures that you have access to the Aspose.Page functionalities.

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsMetadata;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
```

Now, let's break down the example code you provided into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Here, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your XPS documents are located.

## Step 2: Open XPS Document with Print Tickets

```csharp
// ExStart:3
XpsDocument xDocs = new XpsDocument(dir + "input3.xps");
JobPrintTicket pt = xDocs.JobPrintTicket;
// ExEnd:3
```

This step involves opening an XPS document and obtaining its JobPrintTicket.

## Step 3: Remove Parameters from Job Print Ticket

```csharp
// ExStart:4
pt.Remove(
	"ns0000:PageDevmodeSnapshot",
	"ns0000:JobInterleaving",
	"ns0000:JobImageType");
// ExEnd:4
```

Remove unwanted parameters from the JobPrintTicket using the `Remove` method.

## Step 4: Add Parameters to Job Print Ticket

```csharp
// ExStart:5
pt.Add(
	new JobCopiesAllDocuments(2),
	new PageMediaSize(PageMediaSize.PageMediaSizeOption.ISOA4));
// ExEnd:5
```

Add desired parameters to the JobPrintTicket using the `Add` method.

## Step 5: Save Document with Changed Job Print Ticket

```csharp
// ExStart:6
xDocs.Save(dir + "output3.xps");
// ExEnd:6
```

Save the modified XPS document with the updated JobPrintTicket.

Repeat these steps for a hassle-free process of editing print tickets with Aspose.Page for .NET!
