# Add Text to XPS Document with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of .NET development, Aspose.Page stands out as a powerful tool for working with XPS documents. Adding text to XPS documents is a common requirement, and Aspose.Page simplifies this process. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Aspose.Page for .NET to seamlessly add text to XPS documents.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Page library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.Page for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up your .NET development environment. If you haven't done this yet, follow the installation instructions provided in the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Document Directory: Create a directory where you'll store your documents. Replace "Your Document Directory" in the provided code snippet with the actual path.

Now, let's move on to the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, let's import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Create a New XPS Document

To start working with Aspose.Page, create a new XPS document. This will be the canvas where we add our text.

```csharp
// ExStart:3
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
// ExEnd:3
```

## Step 2: Create a Brush for Text

Now, let's create a brush to define the text color. In this example, we're using a black color brush.

```csharp
// ExStart:4
XpsSolidColorBrush textFill = doc.CreateSolidColorBrush(Color.Black);
// ExEnd:4
```

## Step 3: Add Glyphs to the Document

Glyphs represent the text in XPS documents. Add glyphs to the document with the desired font, size, style, and position.

```csharp
// ExStart:5
XpsGlyphs glyphs = doc.AddGlyphs("Arial", 12, FontStyle.Regular, 300f, 450f, "Hello World!");
glyphs.Fill = textFill;
// ExEnd:5
```

## Step 4: Save the Resultant XPS Document

Finally, save the XPS document with the added text to your specified directory.

```csharp
// ExStart:6
doc.Save(dataDir + "AddText_out.xps");
// ExEnd:6
```

By following these simple steps, you've successfully added text to an XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET.

In conclusion, Aspose.Page for .NET provides a straightforward solution for adding text to XPS documents in your .NET projects. The simplicity of the library, combined with its robust features, makes it an invaluable tool for document manipulation.
