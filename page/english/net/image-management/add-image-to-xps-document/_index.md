# Add Image to XPS Document with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, incorporating images into XPS documents is a common requirement. Aspose.Page for .NET simplifies this process, offering a powerful toolkit to manipulate and enhance XPS documents effortlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of adding an image to an XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Page for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [Aspose.Page .NET Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio.

3. Sample Image: Have a sample image file (e.g., "QL_logo_color.tif") that you want to add to the XPS document.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces are vital for utilizing the features provided by Aspose.Page for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

Begin by specifying the path to your document directory. This step ensures that your project knows where to locate and save files.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 2: Create XPS Document

Create a new XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
XpsDocument doc = new XpsDocument();
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 3: Add Image to XPS Document

Now, let's add the image to the XPS document. In this example, we'll use a sample image named "QL_logo_color.tif".

```csharp
// ExStart:1
XpsPath path = doc.AddPath(doc.CreatePathGeometry("M 30,20 l 258.24,0 0,56.64 -258.24,0 Z"));
path.RenderTransform = doc.CreateMatrix(0.7f, 0f, 0f, 0.7f, 0f, 20f);
path.Fill = doc.CreateImageBrush(dataDir + "QL_logo_color.tif", new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 258.24f, 56.64f), new RectangleF(50f, 20f, 193.68f, 42.48f));
// ExEnd:1
```

## Step 4: Save Resultant XPS Document

Save the XPS document with the added image.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
doc.Save(dataDir + "AddImage_outXPS.xps");
// ExEnd:1
```

Now you've successfully added an image to an XPS document using Aspose.Page for .NET!
