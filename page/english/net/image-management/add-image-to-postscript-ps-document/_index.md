# Add Image to PostScript (PS) Document with Aspose.Page

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore the process of adding images to a PostScript (PS) document using the powerful Aspose.Page for .NET library. Aspose.Page simplifies the manipulation of PS documents, offering an efficient and straightforward way to enhance your document with images. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, ensuring you grasp each concept thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Page for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- Document Directory: Create a directory on your system to store the document and image files.

## Import Namespaces

Start by importing the necessary namespaces to your project. These namespaces enable you to utilize Aspose.Page functionality in your .NET application:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.EPS;
using Aspose.Page.EPS.Device;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory

Ensure you have a dedicated directory for your documents. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the code snippet below with the path to your document directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Output Stream for PS Document

Set up an output stream for the PostScript document. This stream will be used to save the modified document.

```csharp
using (Stream outPsStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "AddImage_outPS.ps", FileMode.Create))
```

## Step 3: Create Save Options

Create save options for the PS document, specifying the desired settings such as page size.

```csharp
PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();
```

## Step 4: Create PS Document

Initialize a new 1-paged PS document, and prepare for graphics operations.

```csharp
PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, false);
document.WriteGraphicsSave();
document.Translate(100, 100);
```

## Step 5: Add Image to Document

Load a Bitmap object from an image file and apply transformations. Add the image to the PS document.

```csharp
using (Bitmap image = new Bitmap(dataDir + "TestImage Format24bppRgb.jpg"))
{
    System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix transform = new System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix();
    transform.Translate(35, 300);
    transform.Scale(3, 3);
    transform.Rotate(-45);
    
    document.DrawImage(image, transform, Color.Empty);
}
```

## Step 6: Finalize Graphics Operations

Conclude graphics operations and close the current page.

```csharp
document.WriteGraphicsRestore();
document.ClosePage();
```

## Step 7: Save the Document

Save the modified PS document.

```csharp
document.Save();
```
