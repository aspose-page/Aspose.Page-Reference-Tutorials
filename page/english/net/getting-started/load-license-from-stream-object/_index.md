# Load License from Stream Object with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

Are you ready to take your .NET development skills to the next level? If you've ever felt the need to work with documents, especially in the context of page manipulation, then Aspose.Page for .NET is your perfect companion. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the process of loading a license from a stream object, a fundamental step in harnessing the capabilities of Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of .NET development.
- Aspose.Page for .NET installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).
- A valid license file (e.g., "Aspose.Total.NET.lic").
- Your document directory path ready.

Now, let's get started with the exciting journey of loading a license from a stream object using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Import Namespaces

Before we proceed with the step-by-step guide, let's ensure we have the necessary namespaces imported for our code to function correctly:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Begin by setting up your document directory. This is the location where your files, including the license file, will be stored. Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path on your machine.

```csharp
// ExStart:3
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// ExEnd:3
```

## Step 2: Initialize License Object

Now, let's initialize the Aspose.Page license object.

```csharp
// ExStart:4
Aspose.Page.License license = new Aspose.Page.License();
// ExEnd:4
```

## Step 3: Load License in FileStream

It's time to load your license using a FileStream. Ensure you have the correct file path and replace "Aspose.Total.NET.lic" with your actual license file name.

```csharp
// ExStart:5
FileStream myStream = new FileStream("Aspose.Total.NET.lic", FileMode.Open);
// ExEnd:5
```

## Step 4: Set License

Set the loaded license to the Aspose.Page license object.

```csharp
// ExStart:6
license.SetLicense(myStream);
// ExEnd:6
```

## Step 5: Confirm Success

Finally, let's print a success message to ensure that the license has been set successfully.

```csharp
// ExStart:7
Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
// ExEnd:7
```

Congratulations! You've successfully loaded a license from a stream object using Aspose.Page for .NET. Now, you're equipped to explore the vast possibilities this library offers for document manipulation.
