# Modify XPS Document with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on how to modify XPS documents using Aspose.Page for .NET. Aspose.Page is a powerful library that enables developers to work with XPS files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of adding a signature text, "Confirmed," to specified pages in an XPS document.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Page library installed. You can find the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Download the Required Files: Download the necessary files, including the input XPS document, from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Document Directory: Set up a directory for your documents and update the `dir` variable in the code with the appropriate path.

Now that you have everything set up, let's dive into the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, start by importing the required namespaces for Aspose.Page:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Open XPS Document Stream

```csharp
// ExStart:3
// The path to the documents directory.
string dir = "Your Document Directory";
// Open a stream of XPS file
using (FileStream xpsStream = File.Open(dir + "input1.xps", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
{
    // Create PS document from stream
    XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(xpsStream, new XpsLoadOptions());
    // Continue to the next step...
}
// ExEnd:3
```

## Step 2: Create Signature Text

```csharp
// ExStart:4
// Create fill of the signature text
XpsSolidColorBrush textFill = document.CreateSolidColorBrush(Color.BlueViolet);
// Continue to the next step...
// ExEnd:4
```

## Step 3: Define Pages and Add Signature

```csharp
// ExStart:5
// Define pages where signature will be set
int[] pageNumbers = new int[] {1, 2, 3};

// For every defined page set signature "Confirmed" at coordinates x=650 and y=950
for (int i = 0; i < pageNumbers.Length; i++)
{
    // Define active page
    document.SelectActivePage(pageNumbers[i]);

    // Create glyphs object
    XpsGlyphs glyphs = document.AddGlyphs("Arial", 24, FontStyle.Bold, 650, 900, "Confirmed");

    // Define fill for glyphs
    glyphs.Fill = textFill;
}
// Continue to the next step...
// ExEnd:5
```

## Step 4: Save Changes to XPS Document

```csharp
// ExStart:6
// Save changed XPS document
document.Save(dir + "input1_out.xps");
// ExEnd:6
```
