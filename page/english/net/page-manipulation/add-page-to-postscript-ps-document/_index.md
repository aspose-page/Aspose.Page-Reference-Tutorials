using (Stream outPsStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "document1.ps", FileMode.Create))
{
    // Create save options with A4 size
    PsSaveOptions options = new PsSaveOptions();

    // Create a new 2-paged PS Document
    PsDocument document = new PsDocument(outPsStream, options, 2);
```

## Step 3: Add the First Page

```csharp
    // Add the first page
    document.OpenPage();
