# Add Image Filled Glyph & Foreign Image with Aspose.Page .NET

## Introduction

In the world of .NET development, Aspose.Page stands out as a powerful toolkit for handling document processing tasks. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding image-filled glyphs and incorporating foreign images using Aspose.Page for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to enhance your document processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Page library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a working .NET development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.

- Document Directory: Create a directory where you'll store your documents. This will be referred to as "Your Document Directory" in the code examples.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET application, start by importing the necessary namespaces to access the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Page:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Create the First XPS Document

Begin by creating the first XPS document using Aspose.Page. This document will serve as the foundation for adding image-filled glyphs.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create the first XPS Document
XpsDocument doc1 = new XpsDocument();
```

## Step 2: Add Glyphs to the First Document

Add glyphs to the first document, specifying the font, size, style, and position.

```csharp
// Add glyphs to the first document
XpsGlyphs glyphs1 = doc1.AddGlyphs("Times New Roman", 200, FontStyle.Bold, 50, 250, "Test");
```

## Step 3: Fill Glyphs with an Image Brush

Fill the glyphs with an image brush, utilizing an image from your data directory.

```csharp
// Fill the glyphs with an image brush
glyphs1.Fill = doc1.CreateImageBrush(dataDir + "R08SY_NN.tif", new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 128f, 192f),
    new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 64f, 96f));
((XpsImageBrush)glyphs1.Fill).TileMode = XpsTileMode.Tile;
```

## Step 4: Create the Second XPS Document

Now, create the second XPS document that will incorporate glyphs from the first document.

```csharp
// Create the second XPS Document
XpsDocument doc2 = new XpsDocument();
```

## Step 5: Add Glyphs with the Font from the First Document

Add glyphs to the second document, using the font from the first document.

```csharp
// Add glyphs with the font from the first document to the second document
XpsGlyphs glyphs2 = doc2.AddGlyphs(glyphs1.Font, 200, 50, 250, "Test");
```

## Step 6: Create an Image Brush from the Fill of the First Document

Create an image brush from the fill of the first document and use it to fill the glyphs in the second document.

```csharp
// Create an image brush from the fill of the first document and fill glyphs in the second document
glyphs2.Fill = doc2.CreateImageBrush(((XpsImageBrush)glyphs1.Fill).Image, new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 128f, 192f),
    new RectangleF(0f, 0f, 128f, 192f));
((XpsImageBrush)glyphs2.Fill).TileMode = XpsTileMode.Tile;
```

## Step 7: Save the Documents

Save both the first and second XPS documents.

```csharp
// Save the first XPS document
doc1.Save(dataDir + "out1.xps");

// Save the second XPS document
doc2.Save(dataDir + "out2.xps");
// ExEnd:1
```
