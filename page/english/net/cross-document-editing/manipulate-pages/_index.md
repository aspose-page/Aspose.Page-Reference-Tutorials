# Manipulate Pages with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.Page for .NET! In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of manipulating pages using the Aspose.Page library in a .NET environment. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting, this guide is designed to help you harness the power of Aspose.Page for efficient page manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.Page for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/page/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment with Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
- Input Documents: Prepare XPS documents (input1.xps, input2.xps, input3.xps) for testing.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to access the functionality provided by Aspose.Page. Add the following lines to your code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
using Aspose.Page.XPS.XpsModel;
using System.Drawing;
```

Now, let's break down the example code into multiple steps to guide you through manipulating pages using Aspose.Page for .NET.

## Step 1: Set the Document Directory

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the path where your XPS documents are stored.

## Step 2: Create XPS Documents

```csharp
XpsDocument doc1 = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input1.xps");
XpsDocument doc2 = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input2.xps");
XpsDocument doc3 = new XpsDocument(dataDir + "input3.xps");
XpsDocument doc4 = new XpsDocument();
```

Create instances of XpsDocument for each input document and an empty document for manipulation.

## Step 3: Insert Pages

```csharp
doc4.InsertPage(1, doc2.Page, false);
doc4.AddPage(doc3.Page, false);
doc4.RemovePageAt(2);
doc4.InsertPage(2, doc1.SelectActivePage(3), false);
```

Manipulate pages by inserting, adding, and removing pages as per your requirements.

## Step 4: Save the Document

```csharp
doc4.Save(dataDir + "out.xps");
```

Save the manipulated document to the specified location.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully manipulated pages using Aspose.Page for .NET. This tutorial provided a comprehensive guide to help you get started with page manipulation.
