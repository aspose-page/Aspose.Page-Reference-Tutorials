# Merge XPS Documents into PDF with Aspose.Page for .NET

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of document processing, Aspose.Page for .NET emerges as a powerful tool for seamlessly merging XPS documents into PDF format. This tutorial will guide you through the process, breaking down each step to ensure a smooth and effective execution.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Page for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.Page library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/page/net/).

- Document Files: Have the XPS document (`input.xps`) ready in your specified directory.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.Page:

```csharp
using Aspose.Page.XPS;
```

This step ensures that you have access to the classes and methods required for the document conversion.

## Step 1: Initialize Streams

```csharp
// ExStart:3
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Initialize PDF output stream
using (System.IO.Stream pdfStream = System.IO.File.Open(dataDir + "XPStoPDF_out.pdf", System.IO.FileMode.OpenOrCreate, System.IO.FileAccess.Write))
// Initialize XPS input stream
using (System.IO.Stream xpsStream = System.IO.File.Open(dataDir + "input.xps", System.IO.FileMode.Open))
{
    // ...
}
// ExEnd:3
```

This step involves setting up the input and output streams for the XPS and PDF files. Ensure the correct paths and file names are used.

## Step 2: Load XPS Document

```csharp
// ExStart:4
// Load XPS document form the stream
XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(xpsStream, new XpsLoadOptions());
// or load XPS document directly from file. No xpsStream is needed then.
// XpsDocument document = new XpsDocument(inputFileName, new XpsLoadOptions());
// ExEnd:4
```

Here, we load the XPS document into the `XpsDocument` object, preparing it for further processing.

## Step 3: Initialize Save Options

```csharp
// ExStart:5
// Initialize options object with necessary parameters.
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions()
{
    JpegQualityLevel = 100,
    ImageCompression = PdfImageCompression.Jpeg,
    TextCompression = PdfTextCompression.Flate,
    PageNumbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 6 }
};
// ExEnd:5
```

Customize the `PdfSaveOptions` object based on your preferences, specifying parameters such as image compression, text compression, and page numbers.

## Step 4: Create Rendering Device

```csharp
// ExStart:6
// Create rendering device for PDF format
PdfDevice device = new PdfDevice(pdfStream);
// ExEnd:6
```

The `PdfDevice` is the tool responsible for rendering the XPS document into PDF format.

## Step 5: Save the Document

```csharp
// ExStart:7
document.Save(device, options);
// ExEnd:7
```

Finally, save the document using the rendering device and the specified options.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully merged XPS documents into PDF using Aspose.Page for .NET. This seamless process ensures the preservation of document quality and formatting.
